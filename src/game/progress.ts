/**
 * Everything the game remembers between visits: where you got to, how each field went,
 * and whether you want to see the plan first. One small JSON blob — the game has no
 * accounts and no state beyond the current hunt, so anything more would be machinery in
 * search of a purpose.
 *
 * `localStorage` rather than IndexedDB or a server because the record is a few hundred
 * bytes and, crucially, because reading it is *synchronous*: the right field is up before
 * the first paint, with no flicker of level one on the way to wherever the player left
 * off. That single property is worth more here than durability.
 *
 * Nothing here throws. Losing your place is a disappointment; failing to reach the first
 * field because a value would not parse is considerably worse, so every failure — no
 * storage at all, bad JSON, a field of the wrong type, a level id that no longer exists —
 * degrades to a sane default rather than propagating.
